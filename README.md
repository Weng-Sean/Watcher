# Watcher

## Introduction

The project is a software application designed for managing and interacting with different types of watchers. It allows users to create, start, stop, send commands to, and trace the behavior of watchers. The project includes two primary types of watchers:

1. **CLI Watcher**: This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) watcher that provides a user-friendly interface for managing other watchers.

2. **Bitstamp Watcher**: This watcher is designed to interact with the Bitstamp exchange's WebSocket API for tracking cryptocurrency prices and trades.

The project uses a modular architecture, allowing for the addition of new watcher types in the future.
